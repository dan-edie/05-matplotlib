Project using matplotlib for analysis

This project uses a generated dataset to approximate a pharmecutial company examining drug trials on mice. 
The main purpose is to create plots using Matplotlib and Pandas. 

The toughest part of the project was creating the box-and-whisker plots. These were one type of plot that was
never used in my Physics courses, so it was a bit of a challenge to get the plot to generate correctly.

In addition, and for my own benefit, I also created a histogram and overlayed a Gaussian curve to check to see 
the quality of the data. I still need to work on making the Gaussian fully fit to the plot.

Next steps:
- Examine older code to work on creating better Histogram/Gaussian curve plots.
